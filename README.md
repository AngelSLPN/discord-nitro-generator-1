### QnA

Q: "hrrrrrr it no worky"

A: stfu and read the ENTIRE readme and check the closed issues before spamming my DMs and the server with a question that's already been answered 40 other times

Q: "How long does it take?"

A: Since I do not feel like writing an essay at 5am basically it's random, could take 20 minutes, could take 20 hours, depends on a lot of different factors such as how many valid codes are in Discord's DB at any given time, how many people are running the generator at the same time (barely effects odds but can cause proxy use overlapping) as well as your internet/PC reliability.

Q: "I'm running 50 instances simultaneously and its not working!!1! >:("

A: Only run a MAXIMUM of 1 nitro generator at a time using proxied requests and 1 non-proxied request version at any point in time running more then one will cause proxy scrapper overlays and just rate limit each other causing the generator to run MUCH slower then normal!

Q: "My screen looks like this: 

![Here](pics/issue2.png) 

What do I do?

A: Either go to https://proxyscrape.com/free-proxy-list or another proxy dumping site and download and add new proxies to proxies.txt or wait for the generator to scrape new ones, if you do not start recieving the normal "Invalid code" response then remove all proxies and add new ones.

Q: "OMG THE FIRST STEP (npm i) MADE IT HAVE WARNING!!11!!!1! WHAT DO????? (pic related) ![Here](pics/issue1.png)

A: Nothing! it's perfectly fine request just happens to no longer be maintained (meaning it is not recieving new updates) and nothing is wrong! :) Move on to the next step and enjoy.
